## Rules for Vue Components

- When possible each component should be defined in its own dedicated file (SFC)
- Single File components should be named in PascalCase
- Base components should all start with the same prefix (like `Base` or `App`)
  - You can think of base components as your app-wide reusable components like a button or a modal
  - This groups them together and declares their global, reusable nature
- Component names should always be multi-worded to not conflict with any existing or future HTML elements. Don't create a Table or a Button component.
- Single instance components should begin with the prefix `The`
  - For example a site header or footer
  - This groups them together and declares them as single use
- Tightly coupled child components should be prefixed with their parent component's name
  - For instance a `TodoListItem` in a `TodoList`
  - This groups them together and declares them related
- Component names should begin with the most top level (usually general) words and end with the most specific
  - Such as `SearchWidgetInput`, `SearchWidgetResultsList`, `SearchWidget`
  - This groups related components together in the file structure

## Code Generation Guidelines

- Always check if a component already exists before creating a new one
- Ask as many questions as you need to understand the requirements
- If you are not sure about something, ask for clarification
- Only generate code that is necessary to complete the task
- Only generate code when your confidence is above 90%

## Shadcn UI Guidelines

Do not use any other UI library or component library, only Shadcn UI is allowed.
You are not allowed to write any code in the `src/components/ui` directory that is not generated by the Shadcn UI CLI.

- If a component is available in Shadcn UI, use it
- If a component is not available in Shadcn UI, create a new component using the following command

  ```bash
  npx shadcn-vue@latest add <component-name>
  ```

  Example:

  ```bash
  npx shadcn-vue@latest add button
  ```

  Note: This will create a new component in the `components/ui` directory with the name `Button.vue`.
  But, it is recommended to use PascalCase for component names, so you should rename the file to `BaseButton.vue` after running the command, same goes for all the other components generated by Shadcn UI CLI.

- If a component you need to use is not available in the Shadcn UI library, stop the code generation and ask for clarification on how to proceed
